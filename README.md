# Rocket memory
A small memory game with a sci-fi space aesthetic that started as a simple class assignment and I tried to fully realize into a functional minigame.
Note: The game is currently only playable in Spanish.

## How it's made
The minigame was created using: html, css & javascript.
This proyect doesn't use any framework as its objective was to test my skills before beggining to work with them.

## Features in progress
- English translation
- Settings page
- Fix bugs
