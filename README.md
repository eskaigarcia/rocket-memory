# Rocket memory
A small memory game with a sci-fi space aesthetic that started as a simple class assignment and I tried to fully realize into a functional minigame.

## How it's made
The minigame was created using: html, css & javascript.
This proyect doesn't use any framework as its objective was to test out my skills before moving onto working with them.

## Features in progress
- English translation
- Level selection
- Level timer
- Settings page
